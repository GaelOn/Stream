Use case:

- single thread (done)
- pipeline
- parallel

Operation:

             single thread   pipeline     parallel
- map      | Ok            | Nok        | Nok        |
- flatmap  | Ok            | Nok        | Nok        |
- iter     | Ok            | Nok        | Nok        |
- filter   | Ok            | Nok        | Nok        | 
- fold     | Ok            | Nok        | Nok        |
- sum      | Ok            | Nok        | Nok        |
- min      | Ok            | Nok        | Nok        |
- max      | Ok            | Nok        | Nok        |
- average  | Ok            | Nok        | Nok        |
- collect  | Nok           | Nok        | Nok        |
- join     | Nok           | Nok        | Nok        |


input output strategie:

-> simple array (or everything convertible to array)
-> comsummer producer 

-> -> difficulty of multiple in/out strategy: output stragegy depend on input object (array as stream, consummer as stream)

-> -> difficulty with producer consummer : dealing with aggregate (close signal ?)
