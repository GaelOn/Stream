# Stream
an implementation of stream in C#

Test the Stream approach from the Java 8 in C#. 
Despite of being close to LINQ, Stream differs by manipulating collection element one by one. 
Stream project is monothread implementation which should provide the same feature as LINQ.
We choose to keep the naming coming from functionnal programing instead of the LINQ one.
